#Overview

The Statboard Dashboard UI is built using React with vite bundler for the frontend and utilizes a backend with specified API endpoints. The goal of this project is to demonstrate effective communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring a visually appealing UI. I have used CSS framework Tailwind css for styling and implemented the graphs using npm packages chart js and react-chartjs-2. Using Axios I have connected to the backend api and fetched the data.
